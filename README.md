Chris Leo — Fullstack Frontend Developer (Junior / Rising Talent)

“Building clean, scalable, and visually compelling interfaces with modern web technologies. Always learning, shipping, and iterating.”

About Me

I’m Chris Leo, a passionate frontend engineer with hands-on experience building modern, responsive web applications. My focus is on React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, creating interfaces that are both elegant and maintainable. With less than a year of professional experience, I’ve already shipped multiple projects from concept to deployment, leveraging Vite, shadcn-ui, and modern development workflows to optimize speed and code quality.

I thrive on problem-solving, modular architecture, and rapid iteration, and I’m always exploring ways to bridge design and code. My goal is to contribute to impactful products while continuing to expand my technical breadth, from frontend logic to API integration and real-world feature development.

Project Overview

This repository hosts my interactive portfolio project, showcasing my ability to:

Build modular, reusable components with React and TypeScript

Implement responsive designs using Tailwind CSS and shadcn-ui

Deploy projects quickly with Lovable or Vercel, with instant previews
